"High School and Beyond Fourth Follow-Up Methodology Report. Technical Report.","This report describes and evaluates the methods, procedures, techniques, and activities that produced the fourth (1992) follow-up of the High School and Beyond (HS&B) study. HS&B began in 1980 as the successor to the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. The original collection techniques of HS&B were replaced by computer assisted telephone interviews, and other electronic techniques replaced the original methods. HS&B data are more user-friendly and less resource-dependent as a results of these changes. There were 2 components to the fourth follow-up: (1) the respondent survey which was a computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) based on 14,825 members of the 1980 sophomore cohort, and (2) a transcript study based on the 9,064 sophomore cohort members who reported postsecondary attendance. The response to the respondent survey was 85.3%. Response rate for the transcript study varied from 50.4% at private, for-profit institutions to 95.1% at public, four-year institutions. Technical innovations in this survey round included verification and correction of previously collected data through the CATI instrument, online coding applications, and statistical quality control. Survey data and information about the methodology are presented in 49 tables. An appendix contains the transcript request packages.

"High School and Beyond Postsecondary Education Transcript Study. Data File User's Manual, Contractor Report.","This document is intended as a data file user's manual for the dataset resulting from the High School and Beyond Postsecondary Education Transcript Study. The purpose of this study, conducted during 1984-85, was to provide reliable and objective information about the types and patterns of postsecondary courses taken by all members of the High School and Beyond (HS&B) 1980 senior cohort. Transcripts were requested from each school reported by sample members in their responses to the first and second follow-up surveys. Information from the transcripts, including terms of attendance, fields of study, specific courses taken, and grades and credits earned, were coded and processed into a system of data files designed to be merged with HS&B questionnaire data files. The Computer Assisted Data Entry System was used for processing the collected data into a four-level hierarchy consisting of data at the student, transcript, term, and course levels. The file includes specific data items in the student-level records including: physical tape position on the data record, a short description of the field contents, and the nature of the value stored in the field. Frequently distributions for all categorical variables on the student record are displayed in the enclosed codebook. The appendices, which make up over three-fourths of the document, contain: (1) a list of endorsing institutions; (2) postsecondary school codes in numerical and alphabetical order; (3) course subject codes in numerical order; (4) the data file record layout; (5) information on other HS&B data files available from the Center of Statistics; (6) sampling error and design effects; and (7) frequency distributions.","Access this document on the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) website.","Access this document on the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) website.","http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=ED275743","April 1988","April 12, 1988","April 12, 1988","NCES 1986223 General Ordering Information","General Ordering Information","https://ies.ed.gov/help/orderinfo.asp","NCES","NCES","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&centername=NCES&center=NCES","Calvin Jones and Others","Technical Methods Report","Technical Methods Report","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=producttype&pubtype=032","High School and Beyond (HS&B)","High School and Beyond (HS&B)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsb","Coursetaking/Transcripts  course selection,  High School  high school graduates Longitudinal Studies Postsecondary Education","Coursetaking/Transcripts","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=81&L2=0","course selection","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=81&L2=5","high school graduates","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=251&L2=2","Longitudinal Studies","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=177&L2=0","Postsecondary Education","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=57&L2=0","","","For questions about the content of this Technical Methods Report, please contact:Aurora M. D'Amico.","Aurora M. D'Amico","https://ies.ed.gov/staff/StaffDetl.asp?empid=25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also presented is a revised Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) coding system based on recoding the 485,000 instances of course-taking in the sample. The tentative new taxonomy and decision rules were reviewed by faculties in the appropriate fields prior to final application. Data from the study are presented in tabular form and include the following: percentage of students completing undergraduate courses in 1,037 course categories; percentage of students completing undergraduate courses in 103 aggregate course categories; and distribution of all completed courses by type of institution. Additional data presented cover: basic demography and high school backgrounds of students; highest degree earned; college scholarship support; basic demography of 2/4-year and transfer attendance patterns; date of bachelor's degrees; date of associate's degrees; course of study and degrees earned beyond the bachelor's; and college experiences/attainments.

"NLS-72-Postsecondary Education Transcript Files. Data User's Manual for Revised Transcript, Term, and Course Files. Supplementary Addendum.","This addendum describes the nature, rationale, and results of the second cleaning and revision of the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS-72) Postsecondary Education Transcript Files (PETS). This project, conducted for nearly 3 years, followed an initial cleaning and reduction in 1987, which came about as a reaction to the idiosyncratic records originally submitted by institutions. In this revision, the STUDENT file was left as revised in 1987, but the other files underwent considerable alteration. Four data sets with Statistical Analysis System extensions have resulted: (1) STUDENT3; (2) TRANS4; (3) TERM4; and (4) COURSE4. These include the work of the 1987 revisor P. Knepper. The revised definitions, new terminology, and renamed and altered files are described. Directions for using the modified NLS PETS files are included.

"The National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972: Annotated Bibliography of Studies, 1980-1992.","The National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72) is the ""grandmother"" of the longitudinal studies designed and conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, and is probably the richest archive ever assembled on a generation of Americans. Participants were selected as high school seniors in 1972 and were followed through postsecondary transcripts in 1984. In 1981, Samuel Peng assembled a bibliography of studies describing or using NLS-72 data. This publication extends Peng's work by describing the considerable number of studies published since the first bibliography. Works are arranged in the following categories: (1) general descriptions (data sets and populations); (2) methodology; (3) work (employment); (4) secondary education; (5) postsecondary education; (6) educational and occupational aspirations; (7) educational and occupational attainment; (8) gender and racial-ethnic differences; (9) vocational technical and vocational education; (10) teachers; (11) marriage, family, and life transitions; (12) economics of education; (13) testing; (14) others; and (15) tabulations. In all, 259 sources are listed and annotated with a brief description of the study and its methodology. Publication of this document coincides roughly with the release of an optical data disk with the NLS-72 data archive, manuals, and sample computer programs.

"The New College Course Map and Transcript Files: Changes in Course-Taking and Achievement, 1972-1993. Based on the Postsecondary Records from Two National Longitudinal Studies.","This document presents a national tapestry of what is studied where, and by whom, in U.S. colleges, community colleges, and postsecondary trade schools. The ""Map"" is based on empirical information from national samples of postsecondary transcripts in two national longitudinal studies, the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72) and the High School and Beyond/Sophomore Cohort (HSB/SO). The cohorts of the HSB/SO were scheduled to graduate from high school in 1982. Participation in postsecondary education expanded considerably during the period from 1972 to 1993, but the rate of completing any credentials by age 30 did not increase. The rate of bachelor's degree completion declined in the same period, as did the rate at which bachelor's degree recipients entered graduate or professional school. Time-to-degree increased by 7%, and the average number of credits earned by students also increased. The document has seven major sections: (1) ""Making the Map,"" a description of the methodology; (2) ""Degrees, Majors, Credits, and Time,"" a study of the long-term educational attainment of both cohorts; (3) ""The Changing Shape of Delivered Knowledge,"" the taxonomy of courses derived from the samples; (4) ""Who Provides?,"" the distribution of attempted courses by institution type; (5) ""The Empirical Core Curriculum,"" a study of student course taking; (6) ""Changes in the Proportion of Students Earning Undergraduate Credits in Specific Courses,"" an analysis of changes in student credits; and (7) ""Undergraduate Grades: A Complex Story,"" the analysis of student achievement.

"Service-Learning and Community Service in K-12 Public Schools","Service-learning, discussed here in terms of incorporating community service experiences into students' school work, has long been viewed as a positive education reform option. Beginning in the 1970s, educators began paying more attention to this teaching option and the 1990s saw an array of initiatives to help promote the practice. To determine how extensive the practice is, NCES conducted the first national-level study of service-learning in America's K-12 public schools in the spring of 1999. Analysis of this study reveals a number of interesting results including the fact that roughly one-third of these schools have incorporated service-learning to some extent and that most of the schools that have service-learning provide teachers some sort of support to help them integrate service into their curriculum.","Browse the full report.Download, view, and print the report in a pdf file.  (55KB) Need Help Viewing PDF files?","Browse the full report.","https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/frss/publications/1999043","September 1999","September 28, 1999","October 30, 1999","NCES 1999043 Order Your Free Copy Now From Ed Pubs General Ordering Information","Order Your Free Copy Now From Ed Pubs","http://www.EDPubs.gov","NCES","NCES","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&centername=NCES&center=NCES","Rebecca Skinner and Christopher Chapman","Statistics in Brief","Statistics in Brief","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=producttype&pubtype=017","Fast Response Survey System (FRSS)","Fast Response Survey System (FRSS)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/frss","Community Service,  Public Schools  elementary/secondary Reform, Educational Volunteerism","Community Service","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=56&L2=0","elementary/secondary","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=121&L2=3","Reform, Educational","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=103&L2=0","Volunteerism","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=118&L2=0","","","","","For questions about the content of this Statistics in Brief, please contact:Chris Chapman.","Chris Chapman","https://ies.ed.gov/staff/StaffDetl.asp?empid=206","Download, view, and print the report in a pdf file.","http://nces.ed.gov/pubs99/1999043.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Need Help Viewing PDF files?","https://ies.ed.gov/help/techissues.asp#pdf","General Ordering Information","https://ies.ed.gov/help/orderinfo.asp","","","","","065-000-01275-8","$2.25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A companion paper, Procedures Guide for Transcript Studies, sets forth a set of standard procedures for conducting secondary school transcript analyses with NCES data.","Download, view, and print the report in a pdf file.  (1,595KB) Need Help Viewing PDF files?","Download, view, and print the report in a pdf file.","http://nces.ed.gov/pubs99/199906.pdf","March 1999","May 11, 1999","March 15, 1999","NCES 199906 General Ordering Information","General Ordering Information","https://ies.ed.gov/help/orderinfo.asp","NCES","NCES","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&centername=NCES&center=NCES","Denise Bradby and Gary Hoachlander","Working Paper","Working Paper","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=producttype&pubtype=021","High School and Beyond (HS&B) High School Transcript Studies (HST) National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88)","High School and Beyond (HS&B)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsb","Coursetaking/Transcripts Vocational Education","Coursetaking/Transcripts","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=81&L2=0","Vocational Education","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=52&L2=0","","","","","","","","","For questions about the content of this Working Paper, please contact:Elise Christopher.","Elise Christopher","https://ies.ed.gov/staff/StaffDetl.asp?empid=677","Need Help Viewing PDF files?","https://ies.ed.gov/help/techissues.asp#pdf","","","","High School Transcript Studies (HST)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hst","","","","","","","","","","","National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)","http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard","National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nels88","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"Students Who Prepare for College and a Vocation","This issue brief focuses on high school students who complete both a vocational and a college preparatory curriculum.  The percentage of students who complete both curricula is small but growing. Those who concentrate in vocational areas that use computers most extensively (business and technology/communications) are most likely to also complete a college preparatory curriculum. The academic achievement gains and postsecondary participation rates of students who complete both curricula are similar to those who complete only a college preparatory curriculum.","Browse the issue brief.Download, view, and print the report in a pdf file.  (36KB) Need Help Viewing PDF files?","Browse the issue brief.","http://nces.ed.gov/pubs99/1999072","August 1999","August 31, 1999","August 31, 1999","NCES 1999072 General Ordering Information","General Ordering Information","https://ies.ed.gov/help/orderinfo.asp","NCES","NCES","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&centername=NCES&center=NCES","Lisa Hudson (NCES) and David Hurst (ESSI)","Issue Brief","Issue Brief","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=producttype&pubtype=015","Career/Technical Education Statistics (CTE Statistics) National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88)","Career/Technical Education Statistics (CTE Statistics)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ctes","Achievement (Student) Career/Technical Education Coursetaking/Transcripts Vocational Education","Achievement (Student)","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=2&L2=0","Career/Technical Education","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=197&L2=0","Coursetaking/Transcripts","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=81&L2=0","Vocational Education","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=52&L2=0","","","","","For questions about the content of this Issue Brief, please contact:Lisa Hudson.","Lisa Hudson","https://ies.ed.gov/staff/StaffDetl.asp?empid=229","Download, view, and print the report in a pdf file.","http://nces.ed.gov/pubs99/1999072.pdf","","","","National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)","http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard","","","","","","","","","","","National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nels88","","","","","","","Need Help Viewing PDF files?","https://ies.ed.gov/help/techissues.asp#pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"The Civic Development of 9th Through 12th Grade Students in the United States: 1996","Concern that the next generation of Americans may not be willing or able to engage in the democratic process has been growing. The report is designed to study this concern by focusing on five key factors associated with a desire and an ability to participate politically: levels of political knowledge; attention to politics; political participatory skills; degrees of political efficacy; and tolerance of diversity. These are collectively referred to as ""measures of civic development"" for the purposes of this report. All of the measures of civic development are found in the National Household Education Survey of 1996 Youth Civic Involvement component. The data collected in this survey allow civic development of 9th through 12th grade students to be studied in relation to their demographic characteristics, activities in and out of school, and family and school backgrounds. Of particular interest, because of its prominence in recent educational theory and national dialogues and legislation, is the relationship between students' participation in community service and their civic development.","Download, view, and print the report in a pdf file.  (713KB) Need Help Viewing PDF files?","Download, view, and print the report in a pdf file.","http://nces.ed.gov/pubs99/1999131.pdf","November 1998","December 3, 1998","December 3, 1998","NCES 1999131 Order Your Free Copy Now From Ed Pubs General Ordering Information","Order Your Free Copy Now From Ed Pubs","http://www.EDPubs.gov","NCES","NCES","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&centername=NCES&center=NCES","Richard Niemi, Christopher Chapman","Statistical Analysis Report","Statistical Analysis Report","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=producttype&pubtype=003","National Household Education Survey (NHES)","National Household Education Survey (NHES)","http://nces.ed.gov/nhes","Civic Participation Community Service","Civic Participation","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=7&L2=0","Community Service","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=56&L2=0","","","","","","","","","For questions about the content of this Statistical Analysis Report, please contact:Chris Chapman.","Chris Chapman","https://ies.ed.gov/staff/StaffDetl.asp?empid=206","Need Help Viewing PDF files?","https://ies.ed.gov/help/techissues.asp#pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","General Ordering Information","https://ies.ed.gov/help/orderinfo.asp","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Student Work and Teacher Practices in Science","This is a report written primarily for science teachers. It focuses on samples of questions and student responses taken from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) science assessment that was administered in 1996 to students in grades 4, 8, and 12. Each student who participated in the assessment was required to do a hands-on task; and, slightly more than 60 percent of the questions were open-ended and thus required students to construct their own responses. The report is divided into four parts: The first part (chapter 1), provides an overview of the assessment; the second part (chapters 2, 3, and 4), presents examples of questions and students responses; the third part (chapters 5 and 6) contains information collected from students, teachers, and school administrators about classroom practices, student motivation, and parental involvement in learning; finally, the fourth part contains appendices offering a fuller description of the procedures used for the NAEP 1996 science assessment (appendix A), scoring guides for questions discussed in chapters 2, 3, and 4 (appendix B), and standard errors for the statistics presented (appendix C).","Browse the Highlights of the report.Download, view and print the complete report as a PDF file.  (2,626KB) Need Help Viewing PDF files?","Browse the Highlights of the report.","http://nces.ed.gov/naep/pubs/main1996/1999455.asp ","July 1999","March 8, 2000","July 1, 1999","NCES 1999455 General Ordering Information","General Ordering Information","https://ies.ed.gov/help/orderinfo.asp","NCES","NCES","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&centername=NCES&center=NCES","Christine Y.

"Indicator of the Month: Salaries of Teachers","As school districts compete with each other and other industries for additional teaching personnel to cope with growing enrollments and an aging work force of experienced teachers, attracting and retaining quality teachers is a growing concern among education officials and the public. As a wave of younger teachers hired in the mid-1970s has aged, a demographic shift in the age of teachers has occurred.

"Distance Education at Postsecondary Education Institutions: 1997-98","The purpose of this report is to provide national data on distance education in postsecondary institutions, based on data from a survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) using the Postsecondary Quick Information System (PEQIS). This report, using data collected from 2-year and 4-year postsecondary institutions in the 1997-98 academic year, provides estimates of the number of institutions offering distance education courses, the number of distance education course offerings and enrollments (by field of study and instructional level), and the number of degree and certification programs offered. It also looks at the types of technologies used to deliver education over a distance and at how tuition and fees for distance education compare with those for on-campus courses. More importantly, this report uses data from a previously released NCES report, Distance Education in Higher Education Institutions, to provide much-anticipated trend information for higher education institutions (a subset of all postsecondary institutions). The trend information includes changes from 1994-95 to 1997-98 in the percentage of institutions offering distance education courses, enrollments and course offerings, degree and certification programs, as well as modes of delivery.","Browse this document.Download, view and print the report as a pdf file.  (316KB) Need Help Viewing PDF files?","Browse this document.","https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/peqis/publications/2000013/","December 1999","December 17, 1999","December 17, 1999","NCES 2000013 Order Your Free Copy Now From Ed Pubs General Ordering Information","Order Your Free Copy Now From Ed Pubs","http://www.EDPubs.gov","NCES","NCES","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&centername=NCES&center=NCES","Laurie Lewis (Westat), Elizabeth Farris (Westat), Kyle Snow (Westat), Douglas Levin (AIR)","Statistical Analysis Report","Statistical Analysis Report","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=producttype&pubtype=003","Postsecondary Education Quick Information System (PEQIS)","Postsecondary Education Quick Information System (PEQIS)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/peqis","Coursetaking/Transcripts Degrees Conferred in Higher Education Enrollment Higher Education Internet Access in Schools Postsecondary Institutions Technology Use in Education Tuition/Fees","Coursetaking/Transcripts","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=81&L2=0","Degrees Conferred in Higher Education","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=11&L2=0","Enrollment","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=16&L2=0","Higher Education","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=25&L2=0","Internet Access in Schools","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=108&L2=0","Postsecondary Institutions","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=136&L2=0","For questions about the content of this Statistical Analysis Report, please contact:NCES WebMaster.","NCES WebMaster","mailto:NCESwebmaster@ed.gov","Download, view and print the report as a pdf file.","http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2000/2000013.pdf","","","","","","Technology Use in Education","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=79&L2=0","Tuition/Fees","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=50&L2=0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Need Help Viewing PDF files?","https://ies.ed.gov/help/techissues.asp#pdf","General Ordering Information","https://ies.ed.gov/help/orderinfo.asp","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Vocational Education in the United States: Toward the Year 2000","Vocational education at the turn of the century is an enterprise in transition. This publication addresses the primary question about the size of the enterprise at the secondary and postsecondary levels and whether it is growing, shrinking, or holding constant over time. The report also examines high school transcripts and presents findings about the academic preparation of high school students who participate in vocational education, relevant school reform efforts, and transitions after high school. To set the context for understanding these findings, the report describes economic and labor market trends and their implications for vocational programs, as well as changing workplace practices and employer perspectives on worker skills and proficiency.","Download, view and print the report as a pdf file.  (1,929KB)Download, view and print through chapter IV as a pdf file.  (1,011KB)Download, view and print chapters V-VII as a pdf file.  (337KB)Download, view and print the appendices as a pdf file.  (553KB) Need Help Viewing PDF files?","Download, view and print the report as a pdf file.","http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2000/2000029.pdf","February 2000","January 24, 2000","February 29, 2000","NCES 2000029 General Ordering Information","General Ordering Information","https://ies.ed.gov/help/orderinfo.asp","NCES","NCES","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&centername=NCES&center=NCES","Karen Levesque, Doug Lauen, Peter Teitelbaum, Martha Alt, Sally Librera, MPR Associates, Inc.","Statistical Analysis Report","Statistical Analysis Report","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=producttype&pubtype=003","Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS) Current Population Survey, October (CPS) Career/Technical Education Statistics (CTE Statistics) High School and Beyond (HS&B) High School Transcript Studies (HST) National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS)","Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/bps","Employment  after high school  during college Labor Market Outcomes Preparation for Work Vocational Education","after high school","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=15&L2=2","during college","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=15&L2=1","Labor Market Outcomes","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=31&L2=0","Preparation for Work","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=109&L2=0","Vocational Education","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&searchcat2=subjectindex&L1=52&L2=0","","","For questions about the content of this Statistical Analysis Report, please contact:Lisa Hudson.","Lisa Hudson","https://ies.ed.gov/staff/StaffDetl.asp?empid=229","Download, view and print through chapter IV as a pdf file.","http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2000/2000029_1.pdf","","","","Current Population Survey, October (CPS)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/cps","","","","","","","","","","","Career/Technical Education Statistics (CTE Statistics)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ctes","High School and Beyond (HS&B)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsb","High School Transcript Studies (HST)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hst","National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nels88","Download, view and print chapters V-VII as a pdf file.","http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2000/2000029_2.pdf","","","Download, view and print the appendices as a pdf file.","http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2000/2000029_3.pdf","","","","","Need Help Viewing PDF files?","https://ies.ed.gov/help/techissues.asp#pdf","","","","","","","National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS)","http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/npsas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"The Condition of Education, 2000","The Condition of Education is an indicator report, summarizing the health of education, monitoring important developments, and showing trends in major aspects of education. The 65 indicators included examine relationships; show changes over time; compare or contrast sub-populations, regions, or countries; or assess characteristics of students from different backgrounds and types of schools. An indicator is policy relevant and problem oriented; it typically incorporates a standard against which to judge progress or regression. Please remember, however, that indicators are not intended to identify causes or solutions, and cannot individually by themselves provide a completely comprehensive view of conditions in education.","Browse the Condition of EducationDownload, view and print the report as a pdf file.  (6,155KB)Download, view and print the introduction as a pdf file.  (486KB)Download, view and print the Participation section as a pdf file.  (568KB)Download, view and print the Learner Outcome section as a pdf file.  (588KB)Download, view and print the Student Effort and Academic Progress section as a pdf file.  (552KB)Download, view and print the Quality of El/Sec Educational Environment section as a pdf file.  (686KB)Download, view and print the Context of Postsecondary Education section as a pdf file.  (578KB)Download, view and print the Societal Support for Learning section as a pdf file.  (679KB)Download, view and print the Supplemental Tables appendix as a pdf file.  (523KB)Download, view and print the Supplemental Notes appendix as a pdf file.  (659KB)Download, view and print the Standard Error Tables appendix as a pdf file.  (506KB)Download, view and print the Glossary and Bibliography as a pdf file.  (510KB) Need Help Viewing PDF files?","Browse the Condition of Education","https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/","June 2000","June 1, 2000","July 7, 2000","NCES 2000062 Order Your Free Copy Now From Ed Pubs General Ordering Information","Order Your Free Copy Now From Ed Pubs","http://www.EDPubs.gov","NCES","NCES","https://ies.ed.gov/pubsearch/index.asp?HasSearched=1&centername=NCES&center=NCES","John G.
